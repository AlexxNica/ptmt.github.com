Why would you want to get rid of the inevitable?

You may dissatisfied by many things: slow development of language itself, module systems, ambiguity of "idiomatic way to write scalable projects",
an unprecedented amount of hacks. Many just unlike it, because javascript is not cool enough.

Programming is requires a strong discipline defined by external control over the code.
In Javascript it's all up to you: IDE support, code style checkers or autoformatters, linters, unit tests, a lot of code review.

May be it's worth to invest time to other languages, their ecosystems, and things such as precompiling pipeline, source maps, debugging?

Many people a bit ashamed when they have technical debt, but starting a project in Javascript in 2015 similar to taking out a loan in deep financial crisis.
You can try for a small amount, but I do not advise to take a mortgage.
