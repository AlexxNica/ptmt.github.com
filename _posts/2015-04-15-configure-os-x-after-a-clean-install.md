After a year of using OS X it eventually became extremely slow, even sluggish and unresponsive.

My lack of experience is the main reason behind this, as well as curiosity which leads to apps installations outside the sandboxed App Store. A belief in the power of Time Machine couldn't help you in that, so eventually I've decided to do fresh start in the way how most Windows users do it: the complete re-install the OS. Complete reinstall helps you reevaluate the minimum and keep your third-package apps as short as possible. There is no need in OneNote, once we've got the new Note app.

This is a Gist recipe to setup everything:

Now OS X works flawlessly like it's on the Apple's presentations. 

## TODO:

- Use Applescript to automate OS X preferences.
