Sometimes you have to *see* other people and *talk* with other people.
To validate your idea, or see that really matters along the community.
It happens unfiltered emotions getting lost within tweets and blogs.

I arrived the day before the conference. And took these horrible photos.

Conference talk have to be a **good show** to be enjoyed by most of people.
I really like when a spokesperson does not try to over-produce the effect. When a talk isn't for the sake of talk.

Turned out that afterparty is most unexpected way to actually *learn* something new.

There is a small probability that someday I will stand on the scene.
I have to remember that I most liked being junior-attendee.
