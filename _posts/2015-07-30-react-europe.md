I will remember July 2015 as a local extremum of the hype about React.js.
It's kind of symbolic because at the time Paris has a maximum temperature in years (second time in the recorded history).  
React is exploding fast. I've been writing javascript views as a f(data) for a few months and it feels great.

"_It states that any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript_".

Everything that could be combined with word `React` eventually will be. Add `webpack`, `native`, `redux`, `router`, `example`, `universal` and try to combine by yourself.

I shook hands with almost all of these guys. Smart people really around you means a lot, after all.

This controversial advertisement. It's not funny anymore.

French food. Not only croissants and macaroons.

Music is coming.

The year is 2015. The bunch of mainstream frameworks and popular libs just became obsolete and this will continue.

King.js is dead, long live the King.js!
