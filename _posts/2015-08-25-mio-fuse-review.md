The year is 2025.

You could measure every possible metrics about your body.
You learn your heart, blood, muscles and even the liver (ok, too early for that).
It helps you to get a better insurance or get a better changes on all brand new dating site.
Your everyday all-day-long patterns give NSA so much unuseful information.

When to stop drinking coffee? Is this movie really good or really boring? Measure emotional feedback while watching your show.
Netflix summarize this and give you _true_ recommendations. It turns out to be a tv-show for girls, but don't be ashamed, it's that who you are inside.

Never think about the environment. If a human being could be alive, then the device should too. Waterproof,
I like this moment: you go in the shower and suddenly there is only the cold water. Oouch! The heart is reacting.

Visualization. So that's the point of this graphic without knowing context?

MIO has a great battery for a usual mode (a month). You could easily track your heart all night with high frequency optical sensor.

# +
- Pretty accurate most of the time;
- Waterproof. You are just not worried about it;
- Good battery. 3 weeks as a steps counter or 20 hours with the optical sensor enabled.

# â€”
- Not comfortable to wear all day;
- Poor analytics, it nearly impossible to read patterns, compare progress, etc.;
- Many false measurements above 170+ (MIO FUSE shows its as divided by two);
- Latency;

__TL;DR;__ It's specialized device for some sort of trainings. It is doubtful that it will make your life better.
